## ‚ú® Features

- **Single API Call Analysis**: Upload both PDS and Schedule PDFs with your question for complete analysis
- **AI-Powered Assessment**: Fine-tuned model with conservative assessment framework
- **Structured Responses**: Professional 40-word explanations with percentage-based confidence scoring
- **Multiple Insurance Types**: Supports auto, home, health, construction, and other insurance types
- **Professional Interpretation**: Expert-level insurance policy interpretation
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable FastAPI-based modular design
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health check endpoints
- **PDF Processing**: Robust PDF text extraction and processing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modular FastAPI architecture:

## üíª Usage Examples

### Using cURL

```bash
# Analyze coverage
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analyze-coverage" \
  -F "policy_disclosure=@path/to/policy.pdf" \
  -F "schedule_coverage=@path/to/schedule.pdf" \

# Health check
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health"
```

### Using Python

```python
import requests

# Analyze coverage
with open('policy.pdf', 'rb') as policy_file, \
     open('schedule.pdf', 'rb') as schedule_file:
    
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analyze-coverage',
        files={
            'policy_disclosure': policy_file,
